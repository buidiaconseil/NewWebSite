        <h2>Data Modelling.</h2>
        <p>
          Our work on data modelling target the best tools and methods usable
          for your need.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different models are used. We use multiple and complex regression for
          your data. It includes Ridge, Lasso or PLS models.
        </p>
        <p>We can make complex Statistical model applicable to your data.</p>
        <p>
          We model Timerseries to make prediction using different method as
          Exponential lissage or ARIMA model.
        </p>
        <p>
          We take into the saisonality of your timeseries durint the
          modelisation process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spatial regression model is used to resolve geolocalized data.
          This kind of model is applicable to different geographical application
          as health or marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We manage your longitudinales data in following and modelling cohorts
          and panels.
        </p>
        <p>
          We model complex data structure with indirect or latent variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make complex model to classify your data including Logistic
          Regression and Discriminant Analisys.
        </p>
        <p>For complex modelling we use the Support Vector Machine.</p>
        <p>
          We support unsupervised methods as Kononen Map or associations rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          We support supervised methods as Regression Tree and Random Forest,
          Neural Network and Deep Learning, Boosting and Bagging.
        </p>
        <p>We work on Text Mining, Streaming , Graph and Social Networks.</p>
        <p>
          We make complex visualization systems including complex interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We support Survival and Risk Models as Cox Models We support Multi
          state And Concurent Risk Models.
