                We are expert to sample, transform, evaluate and analyse your data. 
                We estimate the multifactorial densities of your systems. 
                We search for patterns, segments or clusters. 
                We make complex sampling and straightening. 
                We manage the design of your experiments, the quality of the processus, the performance analisys, customers satisfaction, service quality evaluation, Six Sigma and Lean Solutions . 
                We make factorial, hierarchical, mixed and optimal experiments plan. 
                We made Correspondence and Components Analisys on any kind of data. 
                We study saisonality and tendancy of your TimeSeries. we make complex sampling of your data including strata and quotas. 
                We certify your data effect by parametric and non parametric tests. 
                We analyse your geostatistical data to determine effects and correlations.
                We make the automation of your data analyse and results on any platform or statistical software. 
                We optimize the data transformation and calculation for memory and time reduction. 
                We make Massive and Parallel computations.</p>
