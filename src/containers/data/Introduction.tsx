        <p className="lead text-left">
          We are expert to sample, transform, evaluate and analyse your data.
        </p>
        <p>We estimate the multifactorial densities of your systems.</p>
        <p>We search for patterns, segments or clusters.</p>
        <p>We make complex sampling and straightening.</p>
        <p>
          We manage the design of your experiments, the quality of the
          processus, the performance analisys, customers satisfaction, service
          quality evaluation, Six Sigma and Lean Solutions .
        </p>
        <p>
          We make factorial, hierarchical, mixed and optimal experiments plan.
        </p>
        <p>
          We made Correspondence and Components Analisys on any kind of data.
        </p>
        <p>
          We study saisonality and tendancy of your TimeSeries. we make complex
          sampling of your data including strata and quotas.
        </p>
        <p>
          We certify your data effect by parametric and non parametric tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          We analyse your geostatistical data to determine effects and
          correlations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make the automation of your data analyse and results on any
          platform or statistical software.
        </p>
        <p>
          We optimize the data transformation and calculation for memory and
          time reduction.
